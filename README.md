# Sample Project for Kelvin Evaluation System

## Overview

This sample Java project is structured for compatibility with the [Kelvin Evaluation System](https://github.com/mrlvsb/kelvin). Kelvin facilitates the automated assessment of code submissions, providing a beneficial tool for both educators and learners in computer programming.

In this repository, you will find a basic project layout that can be smoothly interfaced with the Kelvin system, ensuring a straightforward experience when assessing Java projects.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── main/
│   └── java/
│       └── com/
│           └── example/
│               └── Main.java
└── test/
    └── java/
        └── com/
            └── example/
                └── MainTest.java
```

### `src/main/java/com/example/Main.java`

The `Main.java` file contains the primary application logic and should include a `main` method, which acts as the application's entry point.

### `src/test/java/com/example/MainTest.java`

The `MainTest.java` file houses the unit tests for the application. These tests ensure that the `main` method and any additional methods in `Main.java` are functioning as expected.

## Usage

To utilize this sample project, ensure that your Java code resides in the `Main.java` file and the corresponding tests are present in the `MainTest.java` file. Follow the subsequent steps to submit the code to the Kelvin Evaluation System.

### Steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Place your Java code and unit tests into the appropriate files.
3. Push your code to a new repository.
4. Submit your project to the Kelvin Evaluation System for assessment.
